So I did something a little bit different with my choose function. Instead of using a recursive factorial function and plugging that into the nCr function, I used a recursive nCr function I found on Wikipedia. The algorithm runs in O(2^n) time with regards to the magnitude of n and r, which, while MUCH slower than using the factorial formula, does allow for a larger range of numbers (or at the very least, what I can do writing assembly code from scratch). Time efficiency aside, the algorithm only uses O(n) space, taking only 4 bytes more per recursive call than what the factorial algorith would have used. 

The only thing I really had trouble with was getting the execution time. I had trouble working with gettimeofday(), and even with the marginally better clock(), I still had trouble retrieving an appreciable value to print. I've left the measurement in seconds as it makes the value more accurate.

I've only tested up to input values of 35, and they all work, albeit, at that point it takes a couple of minutes to execute, so I stopped testing higher values for the sake of my patience.
